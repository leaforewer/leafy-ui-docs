# What is Leafy UI?

Leafy UI is a **multi-framework design system** and **CSS component library** built on top of **Tailwind CSS** — but designed to work seamlessly across **React**, **Vue**, and **Web Components**.  
It gives you elegant, ready-to-use class names and composable React/Vue wrappers, so you can build modern, animated interfaces faster, without losing customization power.

Leafy UI brings the *clarity* of semantic components (like `.pop-btn`, `.accordion`, `.steps`) together with the *flexibility* of atomic utility classes from Tailwind.

# How does Leafy UI work?

Leafy UI is distributed as a set of **NPM packages**:

| Package | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| `@leafy-ui/core` | Framework-agnostic CSS and web components |
| `@leafy-ui/react` | React bindings for Leafy UI components |
| `@leafy-ui/vue` | Vue bindings for Leafy UI components |

Once installed, you can simply import the CSS or the specific component you need.

<Tabs items={['React', 'Vue', 'Web Component']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```jsx
    import { AnimatedLetters, SmallImageCarousel } from "@leafy-ui/react"
    import "@leafy-ui/core/components/leaf-carousel"

    export default function Example() {
      return (
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <button className="pop-btn interactive">Click Me</button>
          <AnimatedLetters text="Leafy UI" />
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```vue
    <template>
      <div class="space-y-4">
        <button class="pop-btn interactive">Click Me</button>
        <AnimatedLetters text="Leafy UI" />
      </div>
    </template>

    <script setup>
    import { AnimatedLetters } from "@leafy-ui/vue"
    import "@leafy-ui/core/components/leaf-carousel"
    </script>
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```html
    <leaf-carousel snap infinite>
      <div class="slide" style="background:#ff9aa2;">1</div>
      <div class="slide" style="background:#ffb7b2;">2</div>
      <div class="slide" style="background:#ffdac1;">3</div>
    </leaf-carousel>
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

# Why should I use Leafy UI?

Leafy UI is for you if you:

- Want **fewer class names** but **more consistent UI**  
- Need **React**, **Vue**, or **plain HTML** support from a single design system  
- Love **Tailwind**, but want more readable code  
- Want **micro-interactions** and **animation-ready** components out of the box  
- Need **maintainable, theme-ready** building blocks for modern projects  

Leafy UI is **not** for you if you prefer to hand-craft every padding and border for every element manually.

# How is Leafy UI different from Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind gives you atomic CSS utilities like:

```html
<button class="px-4 py-2 rounded-lg bg-emerald-500 text-white hover:bg-emerald-600">
  Click Me
</button>
